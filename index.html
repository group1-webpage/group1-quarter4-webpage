<h3>Gathering Information</h3>

<h4>What is the basic information of the typhoon?</h4>
<p>[Super Typhoon Haiyan, also known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, stands as one of the most intense tropical cyclones ever recorded. Originating in the western Pacific Ocean on November 3, 2013, and dissipating by November 11, Haiyan's impact was both devastating and far-reaching. With maximum wind speeds of 230 km/h (145 mph) sustained over 10 minutes and an astonishing 315 km/h (195 mph) sustained over one minute, the typhoon wreaked havoc across Vietnam, southern China, the Philippines, Micronesia, and other regions.</p>
<p>The storm's ferocity led to hundreds of deaths in the Visayas, notably impacting over 14 million people across 44 provinces in the central Philippines. The consequences of Haiyan included the displacement of millions, with over 8,000 people losing their lives and many more rendered homeless. The typhoon also inflicted severe economic damage, leading to nearly 2.3 million people living in poverty, the destruction of 33 million coconut trees—a crucial source of livelihood—and the damage of 1.1 million houses. The estimated total damage amounts to $13 billion.]</p>

<h4>What is the basic information of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon?</h4>
<p>[Typhoon Haiyan, also known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda, was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded. It struck predominantly in the Philippines, notably the Eastern Visayas region, in November 2013.</p>
<p>Geographical Location: The Eastern Visayas region is located in the center of the Philippines and is made up of three major islands: Leyte, Samar, and Biliran. It is bounded by the Philippine Sea to the east, the Camotes Sea to the west, the Leyte Gulf to the south, and the Samar Sea to the north.</p>
<p>Economic Status: Prior to the typhoon, the region was primarily agrarian, with farming and fishing providing the majority of income. However, the storm caused major damage to these sectors, resulting in a serious economic blow. The region has now recovered and rebuilt.</p>
<p>According to the 2010 census, the Eastern Visayas region was home to around 4.1 million people. This figure was anticipated to have increased by the time Typhoon Haiyan struck in 2013.</p>
<p>Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines, killing nearly 6,000 people. The storm also caused extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, and the region's agriculture and fishing sectors.]</p>

<h4>Were there any damages? How severe were they?</h4>
<p>[The Yolanda typhoon was the strongest typhoon in Philippine history during November 2013. The typhoon caused several damages in the area it struck. One of those damages was to the houses. During the Yolanda typhoon disaster, over a million houses were destroyed, causing severe damages to the area. Piles and parts of the houses were spreaded everywhere destroyed by the typhoon. This disaster also caused the deaths of over six thousand people who were not able to escape such a strong typhoon. The Yolanda typhoon was a very tragic event that caused the loss of homes and lives for many people affected by the storm. This typhoon caused over four billion worth of damages, and 2.3 million people were forced into poverty after the disaster.]</p>

<h4>Was the typhoon accompanied by secondary disasters? How did they affect the community?</h4>
<p>[Yes, Typhoon Haiyan was accompanied by secondary calamities, exacerbating the effects on the impacted communities. Here is information about secondary disasters and their impact on the community.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Storm Surge: Typhoon Haiyan generated one of the most devastating secondary disasters, the storm surge. The high winds and low atmospheric pressure forced a large wall of water into coastal areas, causing extensive flooding and substantial loss of life and property.</li>
  <li>Landslides and Mudslides: The typhoon's strong rainfall caused landslides and mudslides in hilly areas. These natural disasters created extra devastation, burying homes, roads, and infrastructure and posed new risks to the impacted communities.</li>
  <li>Displacement and Shelter Issues: The devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan led many people to flee their homes and seek refuge in evacuation centers or improvised shelters. The absence of proper shelter and basic utilities caused substantial obstacles for the impacted communities, resulting in relocation and vulnerability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Thinking Process</h2>

<h3>Empathize:</h3>
<p>The first step is to understand the needs and experiences of those affected by typhoons. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to gain insights into the challenges faced by people in typhoon-prone areas. By empathizing with their experiences, we can better understand their needs and motivations.</p>

<h3>Define:</h3>
<p>Once we have a clear understanding of the challenges, the next step is to define the problem statement. This involves synthesizing the information gathered during the empathy phase and identifying the key issues that need to be addressed. For example, the problem statement could be "How might we minimize the damage caused by typhoons and protect vulnerable communities?"</p>

<h3>Ideate:</h3>
<p>In this phase, we generate a wide range of possible solutions to address the defined problem. This is a brainstorming session where creativity is encouraged. Ideas can be generated through techniques such as mind mapping, brainstorming sessions, or even drawing inspiration from other industries or existing solutions. The aim is to come up with a variety of innovative ideas.</p>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>
<p>Once we have a pool of potential solutions, the next step is to create prototypes. Prototypes can be physical models, digital simulations, or even simple sketches. The purpose of prototyping is to quickly test and iterate on ideas. By creating tangible representations of our solutions, we can gain valuable feedback from stakeholders and refine our designs.</p>

<h3>Test:</h3>
<p>The final step is to test the prototypes with the intended users and stakeholders. This involves gathering feedback, observing user interactions, and evaluating how well the solutions address the defined problem. Through testing, we can identify strengths and weaknesses, make necessary adjustments, and ultimately refine the designs.</p>
